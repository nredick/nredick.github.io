abstract: The uptake of machine learning (ML) has been slow in fields that use geospatially
  informed data, largely because mainstream ML libraries lack functionality for working
  with geospatial data. To this end, we are developing a step-by-step ML workflow
  that will walk users through data input, processing, training, interpretation, and
  deployment. It will include functionality for geospatial contexts, such as aligning
  coordinate reference systems. In addition to making geospatial machine learning
  and deep learning workflows accessible to those without a technical programming
  background, it will be available as a free and open-source software to promote open
  science and reduce access barriers.
