abstract: Pumice rafting events are a common result of volcanic eruptions occurring
  near or beneath bodies of water. Such events are frequently associated with hazards
  such as tsunamis, and drift pumice is known to cause local economic disruptions,
  damage ships, impede naval traffic, devastate marine populations, and distribute
  potentially invasive species over long distances. However, our current understanding
  of the mechanisms that drive the formation and dispersal of drift pumice are extremely
  limited. This article reviews historical and characteristic pumice raft-forming
  eruptions, how interactions with water factor into macro- and micro-scale controls
  on pumice clast formation and dispersal, and current methods for detection and analysis
  to better track and mitigate hazards associated with explosive volcanic eruptions
  and pumice rafts.
