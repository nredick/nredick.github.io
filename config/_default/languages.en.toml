bio = """
I am a graduate student at the University of Californiaâ€”Davis in the geodynamics lab. Currently, I am working on improving slab shape models of the Cascadia subduction zone by linking predictions of the mantle flow around the slab from geodynamic models to seismic observations.

I am interested in marine and volcano geophysics, seismology (especially seismic imaging and tomography), and any opportunity to be in the field."""
